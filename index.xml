      <description>Arrays are usefule, we all know that, they enable us to organize multiple items in one structure. But there is more to them.&#xA;Efficient Memory Storing data in a sequential manner in computer memory allows arrays to be fast and efficient. And of course, there is also more to this, so lets look at a few array types to understand this subject better.&#xA;Static Arrays Since arrays are stored in memory as a single, uninterrupted block, we must know their size at compile time.</description>

      <description>Big-O is a framework for measuring the efficiency of an algorithm.&#xA;Why bother? Big-O notation is used to describe the worst-case time complexity of an algorithm, so we can compare different algorithms and data structures and better predict their behavior as our input size increases.&#xA;Types of Analysis To be able to analyze a given algorithm, we need to know which inputs take less time, and which take longer time.</description>
